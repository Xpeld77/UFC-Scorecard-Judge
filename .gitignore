**Step 2: Initialize Git and Make Your First Commit**
Open your terminal (like PowerShell or Git Bash) and use the `cd` command to navigate into your project folder. Then, run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new, empty Git repository in your folder.
git init

# 2. Add ALL files to Git's staging area.
# (The .gitignore file will automatically prevent temp files from being added)
git add .

# 3. Save your project's current state as the very first "commit".
git commit -m "Initial commit: Create UFC Scorecard Judge project"
```
Your local folder is now a fully prepared Git repository.

### Phase 2: Create the New GitHub Repository

**Step 3: Create the Repository on GitHub.com**
1.  Log in to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2.  Click the **`+`** icon in the top-right and select **New repository**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `UFC-Scorecard-Judge`).
4.  Make sure it is set to **Public**.
5.  **CRITICAL STEP:** **DO NOT** check any boxes to add a README, license, or .gitignore. You want to start with a completely empty repository. 
6.  Click **Create repository**.

### Phase 3: Connect and Push Your Code

**Step 4: Link Your Local Folder to GitHub and Push**
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with several command options. You want the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

1.  **Copy the three lines of commands** from that section. They will look like this:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/UFC-Scorecard-Judge.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
